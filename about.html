        <h2>Subsidy Program</h2><br/>
        <p>
            Our platform introduces a subsidy feature aimed at fostering agricultural development by providing financial assistance to farmers based on their income levels. 
            Under this program, farmers renting equipment through our platform are eligible for subsidies determined by their income brackets. 
            The subsidy amount is directly provided by the government, serving as a crucial support mechanism for farmers, particularly those with limited financial resources. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This initiative not only incentivizes farmers to access much-needed machinery for their operations but also promotes equitable access to agricultural resources, regardless of income disparities. 
            Furthermore, by directly reimbursing equipment owners for the subsidy amount, our platform streamlines the subsidy distribution process, ensuring prompt and efficient financial support to both farmers and equipment providers. 
            Through this subsidy program, we strive to empower farmers, enhance agricultural productivity, and contribute to the sustainable growth of the farming community.

            Moreover, by participating in the equipment rental ecosystem, farmers contribute to the collective sustainability of agriculture, promoting resource sharing and reducing waste.
